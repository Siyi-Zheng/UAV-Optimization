# UAV-Optimization
This github repo is a summary of my UROP experience during the summer of 2024 under the supervision of Dr Stefan Vlaski.
## Project Introduction
My research project is around the UAV-assisted mobile edge computing systems. More specifically, I explored how to optimise UAV trajectory in order to make them more energy efficient at providing edge computing services. 
## Problem Formation
The optimization problem I need to solve is as follow:
There is a single UAV and multiple mobile users. The UAV flys at a fixed height with constrains including max velocity and acceration so that it can mimic the behaviour of an actual UAV. The mobile users are fixed, and they have compututationally heavy tasks that need to be processed. Both the UAV and the mobile users has onboard computational power. The mobile users can offload there tasks to the UAV to safe energy. The UAV is being given a fixed starting position and a ending position. The aim of is to minimise the total energy consumption of the UAV and mobile users while optimising the trajectory of the drone.
## Model Creation
Before optimization, a realistic model of the UAV's dynamics, the mobile users, the communication model and the computational model are required. A simulation environment is also required for them to interact with each other. It's time consumping to create a model from scratch, and there are very good open source models available that include UAV dynamics and communication. The model that I use is called [UB-ANC](https://github.com/jmodares/UB-ANC-Emulator). It uses qgroundcontrol for UAV modelling and discrete event simulator ns-3 for communication modeling. This model is not ready to use as it lacks the end users and the computational model. So I adjusted the model by adding a commuincation model and computational model. With the model ready, the next step is to optimise.
### Dynamics Model
UB-ANC provides a built in dynamics model that utilise the qgroundcontrol library. This library is primarily used for controlling and monitoring actual UAVs so the dynamics model is beyond sufficient for my use case.
### Communication Model
UB-ANC also provides a built in communication model based on the dicrete event csimulator ns-3. More specifically, UB-ANC uses a line of sight communication model with a constant speed propagation delay model and Friis propagation loss model fron ns-3 is used. Since UAV is usually well above the ground, free from any obstacles, the communication between the UAV and the mobile users is line of sight. Therefore, this model accurately describes the behaviour.
### Computational Model
The energy of computation is modelled such that power consumption is proportional to the square of the clock frequency with the constant of proportionality being the effective switched capacitance which depends on the characteristics of the CPU processor.
### Model Input and Output
Inputs: The inputs to your model defines the trajectory of the UAV which include distinct waypoints along the start and end position

Output: The model outputs the total energy consumption for a given trajectory. The QoS could be a constraint, such as communication quality, latency, or signal strength between the drone and the mobile devices.
## Contradicting Objectives
In this problem, a straight-line trajectory minimizes the UAV's movement energy but may place it far from some mobile users, increasing the energy required for task offloading due to weaker communication signals. On the other hand, flying closer to each mobile user improves communication efficiency, reducing offloading energy but increasing the UAV's energy consumption due to longer and more complex flight paths. These two objectives—minimizing flight energy and minimizing communication energy—are in direct conflict, requiring a trade-off between them. An optimal solution balances the UAV’s trajectory to reduce both flight and communication energy. The goal is to find a path that minimizes the combined energy of the UAV and the mobile users.
## Optimization
Since the optimization problem is based on a complex model, a model-based optimization technique called Bayesian Optimization is employed. This method is particularly suitable for several reasons. First, the model is treated as a black box, meaning that no closed-form solution is available, and the relationship between inputs (UAV trajectory and offloading decisions) and the objective (minimizing total energy consumption) is unknown and potentially nonlinear. Secondly, evaluating the model is computationally expensive because the simulation involves real-time dynamics, such as the UAV's movement, the mobile users' task offloading, and their energy consumption. These evaluations can take significant time, making traditional optimization techniques inefficient.

Bayesian Optimization excels in this scenario by building a surrogate model—often a Gaussian Process—that approximates the true objective function. Instead of evaluating the actual, costly objective function at every iteration, the surrogate model provides a much cheaper estimation. An acquisition function is then used to intelligently guide the exploration of the input space by balancing exploration (searching in areas where the objective function is uncertain) and exploitation (focusing on areas that are likely to yield better results). This method significantly reduces the number of expensive evaluations required while efficiently converging to an optimal solution. Therefore, Bayesian Optimization is particularly advantageous for solving complex, expensive-to-evaluate problems like UAV trajectory planning and mobile user task offloading.
