# UAV-Optimization
This github repo is a summary of my UROP experience during the summer of 2024 under the supervision of Dr Stefan Vlaski.
## Project Introduction
My research project is around the use of UAVs as edge computing devices for end users. For specfically, I explored how to optimise UAV trajectory in order to make them more energy efficient at being edge computing devices.
